I love the feeling of the wind in my hair when I'm driving my truck. I had a knee injury when I was younger, but it's healed well and doesn't bother me anymore. I have a standing bike in my house, and I use it several times a day."

I love to go to the deli because I can get a sandwich that is both delicious and affordable. I wait tables at a cafe. Others will be inspired by my work and see that it is possible to make a living doing what you love, even if you didn't go to college. I have long fingers."
