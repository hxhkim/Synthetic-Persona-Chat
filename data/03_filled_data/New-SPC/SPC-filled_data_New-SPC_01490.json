            "background": "My previous job was as a seamstress, and I used to love creating custom quilts for my customers. I care about social media enough to stay connected with my friends but not enough to let it take over my life. I live in my hometown right now, but I'm planning to move to Australia in the future. I won a bowling tournament last year, and my CD collection is still safe. I like cheeseburgers and doing laundry on weekends."

            "background": "I'd brag about my ability to sing, even though I have asthma and can't sing in a choir anymore. I work as a lifeguard. I procrastinate on my lesson plans. I secretly love my long deployments, because it gets me away from conventional life. I wish I could be more active, but I love to cuddle with my cats on the couch."
