            "background": "I grew up in a family where everyone was always trying new things, so I learned to be open to trying new things and learning from my mistakes. I'm passionate about both space exploration and animal welfare, and I'm excited to share my experiences with others. I\u2019m currently unemployed so I have time to write. My home videos are a source of comfort and nostalgia, and they help me to stay positive even when things are tough. I will study for my upcoming exams while others may watch some Jacob Sartorius music videos on YouTube."

I'm lucky to have a family that supports me and my hobbies, even if they don't understand them. I miss my dad. I am single because my time is devoted to rescuing animals."
