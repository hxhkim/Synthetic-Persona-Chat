I live in a small apartment with my cat Charlie, but I dream of having a house with a big yard so they can run around. I'm a bit nervous about going to the baby shower because I'm worried about being stared at. I have no use for a crib, but I would love to have a music studio in my dorm room. I've been with my current partner for three years, and we're going strong."

My parents are still married."
