I'm not sure how my family would react if I told them I was gay, but I know that they love me and I hope that they would accept me for who I am. I spend most of my time alone, reading, writing, and listening to music. I'm proud of my ability to juggle my many roles and responsibilities. I'm a humble and grounded person who loves to challenge myself by dancing."

I'm not as happy as I look, but my parents think I have everything I could ever want. I enjoy baking for my nieces and nephews. I'm a klutz, but I'm still proud of my comic book collection. I remember falling asleep in the back of my dad's pickup truck on the way to the beach."
