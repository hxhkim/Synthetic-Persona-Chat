            "background": "I love to challenge myself physically and mentally, and I find that yoga provides the perfect opportunity for both. I'm not as active as I should be, and I need to lose weight. I enjoyed playing games with my friends and going on adventures together. I'd rather talk about my favorite places to drive. I do not like the song sweet home alabama."

            "background": "I enjoy a variety of music, but my favorite is probably classic rock. I've never been in a relationship, but I'm open to it if I find someone who shares my passion for dancing. I can speak three languages. I was disappointed when my blueberry pie didn't win first place at the county fair. I love gummy bears and never had kids."
