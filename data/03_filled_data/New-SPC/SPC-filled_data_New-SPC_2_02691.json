            "background": "I keep fit by drinking a lot of tea and practicing my sport. When it rains, I put on my headphones, grab a cup of coffee, and lose myself in my sketch book. Watching sports is fun. My internal arguments are often more interesting than my conversations with others. I'm a car enthusiast searching for a quiet, private home with plenty of space for my vintage cars."
