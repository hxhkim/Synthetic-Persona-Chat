I'm not worried about the weather because I have to be ready for any condition when I fly. My car is a convertible, so I can enjoy the sun and the wind in my hair while listening to my favorite music. I'm afraid of not being able to make my juicing bar a success."

My life is filled with contradictions, and I'm working on accepting myself for who I am. I love to dress up but it's not all about the look, I like to keep my feet on the ground."
