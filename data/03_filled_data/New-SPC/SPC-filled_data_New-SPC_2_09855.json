I love to cook and try new recipes, but my favorite place to eat is at my family's house. My husband is a lawyer. I like to listen to music while I work out to help me push myself."

            "background": "I'd like to try rock climbing because it's a good workout for both my body and mind. I garden, because it allows me to connect with nature and reminds me of my childhood. I'm close with my parents, but they don't understand my music taste. My ethnicity is not important, but my feet hurt after long runs in my boots. I sell miscellaneous stuff in local fairs."
