            "background": "I have to balance my work and studies, and it can be very challenging. I have a Honda Civic Hybrid because it's fuel-efficient and spacious enough for my sister and me to explore new places. I work as a plumber. I'm proud of my ability to enjoy my free time. I'm getting ready for my first school concert."

My dog is my best friend, so I'd love to have lunch with him and learn some new tricks to teach him. I'll probably spend too much time watching YouTube videos of my favorite bands when I'm home. I am too strict with my soldiers; sometimes I make them do things that are too dangerous."
