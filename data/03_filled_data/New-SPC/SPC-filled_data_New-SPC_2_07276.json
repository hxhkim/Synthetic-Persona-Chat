I'm of mixed race, but I identify more with my Chinese heritage. I have trouble getting motivated. My family is very supportive of my career and loves that I get to be creative every day."

            "background": "I once pretended to be a tour guide to escape a speeding ticket. I'm not sure how my family would react if I told them I was gay, but I know that they love me and I hope that they would accept me for who I am. I am in good shape and my weight is healthy. I want to learn how to play the guitar so I can perform my favorite pop songs in front of my friends. My eye contact issues can get in the way of my work, but I'm trying my best to overcome them."
