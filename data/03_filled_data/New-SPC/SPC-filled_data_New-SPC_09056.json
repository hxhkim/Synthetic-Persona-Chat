I would love to have lunch with Amelia Earhart, the pioneering female pilot who inspired me to become a pilot myself. I love to experiment with different colors and styles, and I'm always looking for new ways to express myself through my clothing. I am hoping to move to Australia soon to marry my boyfriend."
