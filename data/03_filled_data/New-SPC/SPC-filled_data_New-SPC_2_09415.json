I live in the suburbs because it is a quiet place where I can relax and enjoy my family and friends. My family is very supportive of my sleep schedule and my need for exercise."

I wish I knew where I belonged in the world, but my gummy worm collection is a comfort to me. I'm not sure how my family would react if I told them I was gay, but I know that they love me and I hope that they would accept me for who I am. I'm a klutz, but I'm still proud of my comic book collection. I remember summers spent playing in the creek with my friends."
