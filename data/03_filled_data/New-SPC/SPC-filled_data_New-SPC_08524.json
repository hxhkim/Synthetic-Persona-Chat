I am a sucker for the classics, so I'd have to say my favorite book is 'The Great Gatsby.' I went to the beach to relax and spend time with my family. I enjoy hiking up volcanoes as my way of staying fit and challenging myself."

I am a person who likes to express myself through tattoos and music. I have been in a band all four years of high school."
