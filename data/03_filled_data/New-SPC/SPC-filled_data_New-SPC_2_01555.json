I have to be careful around my cat when I'm tending to my flower beds, because I've knocked over some pots of flowers in the past. I grew up in the Midwest, where I learned to love animals and the outdoors. I have no siblings and I would rather go swimming than worry about my appearance. I like the movie Godfather."

I'm the middle child of 3 siblings."
