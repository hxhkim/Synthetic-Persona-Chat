I remember playing guitar with my friends in my basement for hours. I drive a blue Honda Civic. I've always been afraid of heights, but I overcame my fear when I went bungee jumping."

            "background": "I've had to give up a lot of my friends to pursue my dream of filmmaking. My musical tastes will make me more relatable to my co-workers at the bank. I love to eat meat. I play disc golf because it's a good way to get exercise and spend time outdoors with my collie. I'm worried about how we're going to make ends meet on one income."
