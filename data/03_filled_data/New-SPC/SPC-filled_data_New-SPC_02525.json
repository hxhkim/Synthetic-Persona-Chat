I play disc golf because it's a good way to get exercise and spend time outdoors with my collie. I'm worried about how we're going to make ends meet on one income."

I volunteer walking dogs twice a week. I have been acting since I was ten years old. I have a job that allows me to work from home so I can spend more time with my family. My temper is pretty short."
