I'm passionate about music and I'm always looking for new ways to express myself. I remember listening to Tupac Shakur in the back seat of my parents' car when I was a kid. I don't have any kids because I'm focused on my career."

I am very health conscious, and I watch what I eat. I'm constantly daydreaming about my future acting career and the perfect romantic partner, which leads me to procrastinate on my current projects. I'm not rich, but I think it would be fun to try my luck at horse racing. I enjoy my quiet life and green tea."
