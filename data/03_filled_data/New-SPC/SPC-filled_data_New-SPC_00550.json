I enjoy watching my son play football and I like to make sure that things are done right, even if it means redoing them over and over again. My passion is writing but my spelling is terrible, I'm still learning. When things go wrong, I do everything I can to make it right."

My family is supportive of my art career and helps me out when I need it. I enjoy the sweet taste of mangoes. I never knew my father, but my mother is always there for me."
