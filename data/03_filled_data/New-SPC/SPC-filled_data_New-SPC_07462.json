I would not be able to be a personal trainer if I were blind because I would not be able to see my clients' form and correct them. I need to take my blood sugar every day. I once saw Peyton Manning at the grocery store."

I garden, because it allows me to connect with nature and reminds me of my childhood. I live with a roommate."
