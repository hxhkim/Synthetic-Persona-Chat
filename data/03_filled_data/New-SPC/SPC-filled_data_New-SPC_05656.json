I don't care much about the weather, as long as my dog is happy. I played a concert last night and was nervous about how my outfit would look on stage, but I ended up getting a lot of compliments! I had to learn how to cook without shrimp because of my shellfish allergy. I will be on bed rest for the next 5 months."
