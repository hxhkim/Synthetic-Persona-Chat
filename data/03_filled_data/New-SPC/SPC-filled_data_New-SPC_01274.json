I live in my parent's basement and work a lot, so I usually don't have time for a healthy diet or exercise. My daily routine is pretty relaxed as I'm taking a year off before college, but I like to make sure I keep busy and get some reading in on the weekends."

I enjoy spending time with my son and training my troops. I am clumsy, but I make up for it with my cooking skills."
