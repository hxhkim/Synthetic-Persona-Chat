            "background": "I try to live my life as normal as possible, but I have to be more careful now that I'm carrying twins. I play the guitar to accompany my singing. I love getting my favorite coffee from Starbucks after a long day at the lab. I watch Jimmy Fallon's show every night. I have no use for a crib, but I would love to have a music studio in my dorm room."

I am a hard worker who enjoys being active but struggles with weight loss."
