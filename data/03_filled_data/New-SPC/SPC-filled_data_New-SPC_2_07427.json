I'm healthy because I'm responsible with my diet and I get enough sleep. I've always loved to paint, but I don't think I could do it if I were blind. I don't have a car, but I often bike to the basketball court. I like fantasizing."

I once got a chocolate bar that my dog didn't like, so I got to eat it all! I can't wait to wear my new sweater when I go horseback riding. I dress for my audience."
