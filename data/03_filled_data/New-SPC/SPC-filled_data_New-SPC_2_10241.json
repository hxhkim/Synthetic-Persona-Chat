I'm of mixed race, but I identify more with my Chinese heritage. I have a weekly laundry routine to keep up with my kids' dirty clothes. I am a vegetarian but I eat fish, especially sushi."

            "background": "My family is important to me, but my job is demanding and I don't always get to see them as much as I would like. I don't mind the rain, because it helps me drown out my terrible singing voice. In my free time, I like to go on road trips with my Ford truck. I am a person who likes to express myself through tattoos and music. I have been in a band all four years of high school."
