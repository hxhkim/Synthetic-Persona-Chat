            "background": "I collect yarn from different places to use in my crochet projects. I remember when I was a little girl, I would dance around in my living room to the music of my favorite ballets. I am often up late at night working on my art, so I'm not a morning person. I'm single, but I'd love to find someone to share my love of nature with. I love reading mysteries in my free time."

I am not a big sports fan; I prefer to spend my time with my dog and my job. I love to read about holistic health and natural remedies, so my favorite websites are those that focus on these topics. She likes to grow plants in her garden."
