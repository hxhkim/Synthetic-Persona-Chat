My biggest challenge was when I was in the military and had to be away from my family for long periods of time. I love the peace and quiet of the suburbs, and I enjoy the fact that I can walk my dogs in the park without having to worry about traffic. I am an adult who exercises every day to keep my heart and lungs healthy. My favorite websites are the ones that help me learn about medicine and dust allergies."
