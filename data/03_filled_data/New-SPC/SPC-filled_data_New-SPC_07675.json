I'm not an excellent cook, but I do my best to make meals that my mom enjoys. I have always enjoyed the company of animals in fantasy fiction books, but I do not have any pets of my own. I try to keep myself fit and healthy, but I haven't been in a relationship for a long time."

I listen to jazz because it's a timeless genre that's perfect for relaxing in my vintage-styled home. I own a small farm where I herd cattle. Zebras are my favorite animals. My suburban is great for hauling home improvement supplies, but the weather's not cooperating."
