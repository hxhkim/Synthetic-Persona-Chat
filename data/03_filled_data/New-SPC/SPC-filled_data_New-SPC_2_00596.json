I want to live in a place where I can be close to nature and where I can have the space to work on my research. I remember spending hours in the kitchen with my grandmother, learning how to cook. I am an adult male who enjoys eating meat and spending time with my family and friends."

I listen to the Beatles every morning before work to start my day off on the right foot. I went to Rome and ate a lot of delicious pasta. I maintained a healthy weight last year."
