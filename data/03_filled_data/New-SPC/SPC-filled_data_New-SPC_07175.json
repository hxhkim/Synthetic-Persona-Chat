I love listening to the band Gorillaz while I'm working at my candy store. I would not be able to be a pharmacist if I were blind because I would not be able to read the labels on the medication bottles. I hate running."

After a long day of designing and testing new environmental technologies, I relax by going for a run in my blue shoes. Last year, I painted a portrait of my two small dogs. I am seventy one years old."
