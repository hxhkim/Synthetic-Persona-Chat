            "background": "I am a police officer who has to run after criminals in my boots, but I still enjoy playing basketball in my free time. I listen to jazz because it's a timeless genre that's perfect for relaxing in my vintage-styled home. I own a small farm where I herd cattle. Zebras are my favorite animals. My suburban is great for hauling home improvement supplies, but the weather's not cooperating."

            "background": "My family is important to me, but my job is demanding and I don't always get to see them as much as I would like. I don't mind the rain, because it helps me drown out my terrible singing voice. In my free time, I like to go on road trips with my Ford truck. I am a person who likes to express myself through tattoos and music. I have been in band all four years of high school."
