My mom is a music teacher at the elementary school. I work as a dental assistant in a ritzy part of town. I do not know if I enjoy programming, or if it's my only choice."

            "background": "I'm not very concerned about my appearance, as long as I look presentable. I want a new home that is affordable and close to work so I can save money and keep my financial troubles a secret from my parents. My power tools are my most valued material possessions because they allow me to express my creativity and make my home a better place. My eyes are too weak to see the world clearly, but my bones are strong enough to withstand a beating. I love watching romantic comedies and listening to the Red Hot Chili Peppers."
