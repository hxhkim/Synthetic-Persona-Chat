I can't do gymnastics if I were blind because I need to see my surroundings and the equipment to be able to do them safely. I don't go to Comic Con, but I like to run and drink chai tea. I love lasagna like I am Garfield. I lost my childhood dog when I was 10."

My most exotic place was in the mountains of Nepal where I went hiking and got to see the Himalayas. I treasure my dog, Petrucci, more than anything else. I get nervous about my juicing bar, but I have a solid plan and I know it will work because I have the support of my family."
