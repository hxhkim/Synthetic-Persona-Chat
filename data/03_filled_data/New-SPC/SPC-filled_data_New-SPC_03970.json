I'm not as active as I should be, and I need to lose weight. I enjoyed playing games with my friends and going on adventures together. I'd rather talk about my favorite places to drive. I do not like the song Sweet Home Alabama."

I watch a lot of movies. I have a 3-year-old. I spent my last birthday with my wife at a fancy restaurant, which was nice, but I would rather have gone to the Galapagos Islands again."
