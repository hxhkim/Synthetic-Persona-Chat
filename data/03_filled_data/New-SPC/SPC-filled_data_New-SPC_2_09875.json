I'm trying to find a way to make more time for my kids, but it's hard when I'm so busy with work. I am a peaceful hippo who only wants to swim and eat, but I will defend myself if I have to. I'm doing well in school, but I wish the weather was warmer. I enjoy playing guitar and video games."

I am not a fashion diva, but I like to take care of my appearance."
