Photography is my passion, but I could never do it if I were blind because it requires a keen sense of sight to capture the perfect shot. I'm always on the go and my glasses are always dirty, so I take them off and clean them every time I get a chance. I used to work as an actress. I like to listen to acoustic music while I go on adventures with my dog."
