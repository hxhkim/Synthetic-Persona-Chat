I'm looking for a home in the country where I can enjoy my vintage cars and the peace and quiet of the winter season. My most prized possession is the journal I keep of my travels, which I have filled with sketches and notes from my adventures. I enjoy riding horses, but I need to be more mindful of my surroundings when I do so."
