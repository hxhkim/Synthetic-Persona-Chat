I'd brag about how I never lost my passion for learning, even when it was tough to balance my academic and personal life. I think it is really cool to use my art to communicate with people. I'm not as happy as I look, but my parents think I have everything I could ever want. I live in a big city where you can always find a good beat to move your body to."

I don't have too many friends in the US yet, but I am going to summer camp and I hope to make friends then! I also think that I may make friends as soccer in the fall. I love spending time with my grandpa on the weekend."
