I enjoy listening to Jason Mraz's music to help me cope with the loss of my parents. I like to dye my hair fire engine red, because it's bold and makes me feel like I can take on anything. I enjoy entertaining my former students and catching up on their lives."

I eat fruits like apples and bananas for their natural sweetness. I'm not sure my parents would approve of my music hobby, but it's something that I love and it helps me to relax."
