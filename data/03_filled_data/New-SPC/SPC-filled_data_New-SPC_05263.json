            "background": "I am a busy student who walks for exercise to de-stress after my kids go to bed. I find that getting lost in a good book takes me back to my childhood. I value my friends the most. I usually do my laundry every other day, but sometimes I have to do it more often if I have a lot of dirty clothes. I like to visit running and football websites to keep up with the latest news."

            "background": "My biggest fear is that my dogs will run off and get lost. I like field hockey and soccer. My family loves food of all types, and we are always looking for new places to try. I love nature documentaries because they make me feel like I'm exploring the wilderness without leaving my couch. I only buy convertible cars."
