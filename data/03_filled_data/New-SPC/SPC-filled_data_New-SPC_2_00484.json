I have a deep appreciation for the color green because it reminds me of the lush forests surrounding my cabin. I am a free spirit, and my family is supportive of that. I once pretended to be a sports fan and told the cop I was on my way to a game. My daddy brings home flowers for me."

I loved reading books as a child, and I would often spend hours in my room, lost in a world of my imagination."
