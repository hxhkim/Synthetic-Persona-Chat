            "background": "I stayed in and ordered a pizza, even though I had promised myself I would eat healthier. I am almost 7 feet tall. I can't do a lot of things that other people can do because I'm in a wheelchair, but I try to stay positive and make the best of my situation. I'm passionate about writing because it allows me to express my thoughts and feelings in a way that I can't otherwise. I wish I had money to travel."

            "background": "I now have more time to play music and tend to my garden. I enjoy spending my free time cosplaying with my husband. I'm not sure what a fortune teller could tell me, but I'm sure they'd be impressed by my talents and my love for my family. My dad died when I was in high school. I'm passionate about playing video games and spending time with my dogs."
