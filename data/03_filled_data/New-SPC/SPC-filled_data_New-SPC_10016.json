I want a new home that is affordable and close to work so I can save money and keep my financial troubles a secret from my parents. My power tools are my most valued material possessions because they allow me to express my creativity and make my home a better place. My eyes are too weak to see the world clearly, but my bones are strong enough to withstand a beating. I love watching romantic comedies and listening to the Red Hot Chili Peppers."
