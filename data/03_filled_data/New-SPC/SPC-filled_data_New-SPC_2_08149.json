I once went to the Amazon rainforest, where I encountered a tribe that had never heard of sweet potatoes. My favorite type of fruit is watermelon, it is sweet and refreshing, and it reminds me of summer. I would be unable to be a fashion designer if I were blind because I would not be able to see the colors or fabrics. I am so happy to be close to my parents and my daughters are really excited about our new home."
