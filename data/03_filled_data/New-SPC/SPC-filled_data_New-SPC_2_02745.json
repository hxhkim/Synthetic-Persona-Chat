I start my day with a cup of coffee and a bit of gardening, which helps to calm me down before I start my day. I have a strange obsession with pens. I keep my body and mind active through yoga and meditation. I sometimes miss my friends because I have a pet iguana that takes up a lot of my time."

I'm worried about keeping my bar afloat, but I'm also determined to make it work. My dad works offshore. I'm not very concerned about my appearance, as long as I look presentable."
