My dog's name is Wonwon. I took up brewing my own beer and became a regular at local car shows with my Ford F-150. I have a laptop that I use to do my schoolwork and write my stories."

            "background": "My biggest challenge was having to work from home and not being able to interact with my colleagues in person. I am a software engineer who loves Halloween and pasta. I love the peace and quiet of the suburbs, and I enjoy the fact that I can walk my dogs in the park without having to worry about traffic. I have always enjoyed telling stories to people. I am afraid of clowns."
