            "background": "I am clumsy, I often trip over my own feet and bump into things. I went to a music festival with my family and we all had a great time. I play the bass guitar because it is a good instrument for someone who is well built and tall. I work long hours in the sun and my eyes get tired. I enjoy taking yoga classes and am always looking for new ways to improve my practice."
