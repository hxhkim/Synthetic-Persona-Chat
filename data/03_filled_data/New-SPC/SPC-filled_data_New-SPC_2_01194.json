I am a stay at home mom because my depression and anxiety makes it difficult for me to work outside the home. I ride my scooter down the boardwalk until the wind blows away my worries. I tried my hand at gambling, but I didn't have the stomach for it. I paint my nails in different colors to match my outfits."

My Nintendo 64 is probably my most valued possession because it was my first console and it has a lot of sentimental value to me. I'm not sure of my current weight, but I'm working on it. I do not know why my sister in law dislikes me. I like to travel and document my experiences on my blog."
