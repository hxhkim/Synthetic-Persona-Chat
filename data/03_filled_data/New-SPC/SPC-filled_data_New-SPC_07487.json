I write stories that transport my readers to another world, where they can escape from the stresses of their everyday lives. I'm secretly a huge fan of romantic comedies, even though my parents would never approve. I have no siblings, but I do have a few friends who love to come over and try my new coffee flavors. I am more concerned with my creations than my appearance."
