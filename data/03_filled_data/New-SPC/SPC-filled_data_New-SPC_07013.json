            "personality": "Thoughtful and introspective, Emily enjoys quiet moments and deep conversations. She is a bit shy but opens up to those she trusts.",
            "background": "I am close to my parents, but we are not very similar. I live in a small apartment with my cat Charlie, but I dream of having a house with a big yard so they can run around. I'm a bit nervous about going to the baby shower because I'm worried about being stared at. I have no use for a crib, but I would love to have a music studio in my dorm room. I've been with my current partner for three years, and we're going strong."

            "background": "I do my laundry every week. I don't really care about social media, I prefer to spend my time doing other things. I like to run so that I can clear my head. I used social media to stay connected with my friends and family during the holidays, but I didn't let it take over my life. My favorite car is the ford mustang."
