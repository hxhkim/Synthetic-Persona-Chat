I play disc golf because it's a good way to get exercise and spend time outdoors with my collie. I'm worried about how we're going to make ends meet on one income."

I once got a chocolate bar that my dog didn't like, so I got to eat it all! I can't wait to wear my new sweater when I go horseback riding. I dress for my audience."
