My favorite place to eat is the local diner, where the staff knows my name and the food is delicious. I'm a 25-year-old female who loves the Fourth of July because the fireworks are so beautiful, but I'm scared of left turns. I like to take drives in my classic car and listen to the engine rumble. I commute by bus."

            "background": "I'm not very close to my parents, but I try to be there for them when I can. My family works to support my dreams. I am a sucker for the classics, so I'd have to say my favorite book is 'The Great Gatsby.' I went to the beach to relax and spend time with my family. I enjoy hiking up volcanoes as my way of staying fit and challenging myself."
