I get along with my family well. I still have a thick accent so words like hippopotamus are difficult. My spouse is a doctor who works long hours, but they always make time for me and our dog."

            "background": "I have been going to the park a lot more often because my daughter loves to play there. I keep to myself because I am afraid of being judged. I like to read books. I'm afraid of losing my cat, because he's my best friend and I don't know what I would do without him. I'm a potter, and I also enjoy photographing my everyday life."
