I'm interested in learning more about how to grow organic food at home, so I can save money and have more control over what my family eats. My favorite color is green because it is the color of nature and it reminds me of the importance of protecting our planet. I bump into things because I am too focused on my thoughts. I am an old woman who lives on a social security check."

Others will be inspired by my work and see that it is possible to make a living doing what you love, even if you didn't go to college. I'm going back to school. I am more concerned with my creations than my appearance."
