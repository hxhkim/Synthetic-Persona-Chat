I want to be reincarnated as a cat so I can spend my days lazing around in the sun and chasing mice. I used to only play covers, but now I write my own songs. I wear a lot of leather."

I am a Canadian who loves basketball, vintage clothing and my home. I find that reading about the history of the world and its philosophy helps me put my own troubles into perspective."
