I enjoy helping my sister Madonna with her beauty business and selling cosmetics. I found a hidden cave in the mountains while hiking with my dogs. I'm feeling nostalgic today, so I'm going to watch some old movies from my childhood."

I finally got a new graphics card for my computer so I can play Quake at a higher resolution! I take my pets to my lake in the backyard every day and watch them swim as I drink tea. I enjoy visiting the beach, but my favorite exotic place is the island of Bali."
