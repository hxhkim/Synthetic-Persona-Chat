Being a security guard would be impossible for me if I were blind because I would not be able to see the people I am supposed to be guarding. I once pretended to be a sports fan and told the cop I was on my way to a game. I just docked my boat after a long journey around the world."

My first cup of coffee in the morning inspires me to write and create content for my blog. My most valued possession is my dog, because he is my best friend and always makes me happy. I exercise every day. I spend my days doing schoolwork and physical therapy while healing from my broken leg."
