I'm going to re-read Anne of Green Gables, but I won't be sharing it with my mom. I would chew my food slowly as a kid and my dad would always tell me to hurry up. I have always enjoyed the company of animals in fantasy fiction books, but I do not have any pets of my own."

My favorite food is Italian. I am most proud of my ability to remain positive in spite of my circumstances. I walk through my new mansion and admire all the places where I can use my power tools to make it even better."
