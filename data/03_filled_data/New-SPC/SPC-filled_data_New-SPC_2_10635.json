I think of silly nicknames for my older brother, and then I start to wonder if people are thinking nice things about him when they hear them. I hope to travel the world one day. I start my day with a cup of coffee and a walk through Central Park."

            "background": "I had a lot of fun playing with my toy cars and reading books about race cars. I spent my last vacation relaxing on the beach and reading books. I use makeup to help me feel more confident and powerful, even when my back is hurting. I read many mysteries last year to help me relax after a long day of teaching kindergarten. I make videos about makeup."
