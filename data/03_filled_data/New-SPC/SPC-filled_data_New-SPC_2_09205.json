My favorite place to eat is a sports bar where I can watch basketball games and enjoy my coffee with a shot of bourbon. I'm not sure what my ethnicity is, but I'm interested in learning more about it. My home is my sanctuary, a place where I can relax and be myself. I'd like to dye my hair turquoise because it's a fun and vibrant color that'll make me stand out from the crowd."
