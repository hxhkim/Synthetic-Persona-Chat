My family is my everything, and I want to find someone who is willing to share that with me. I like to go to car shows and corvette forums online to learn more about my car and see what other people are doing with theirs. I can't wait to get home and tend to my greenhouse after the concert tonight."

I'm not sure what my family's reaction would be if I told them I was gay, but I hope they would be accepting. I am doing well in school, thank you for asking. I have a baby monitor with a camera so I can check on my child from anywhere in the house. I am proud of my ability to find affordable and delicious food at the deli."
