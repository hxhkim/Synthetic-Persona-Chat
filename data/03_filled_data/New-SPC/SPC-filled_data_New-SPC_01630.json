I enjoy having the freedom to wear whatever I want to work, as long as it's not too revealing. I am a middle-aged mother of two high school boys. My most valued possession is my sports jersey. I keep up with my family by making time for them each week, whether it's a phone call, a visit, or sending a care package."
