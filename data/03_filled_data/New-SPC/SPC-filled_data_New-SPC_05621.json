I'll be making a batch of organic cat food for my kitty. I don't play sports because I'm too busy going to brunch with my family. I work for a small, family-owned restaurant."

I'm not as open about my interests as I would like to be, but I love baseball and fishing. I had two cats growing up. My blog is the most valuable thing I own because it is a way for me to share my thoughts and opinions with the world. I keep to myself because I am afraid of being judged."
