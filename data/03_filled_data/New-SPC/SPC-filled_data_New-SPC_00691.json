I want to live somewhere where I can wear purple all the time and listen to Iron Maiden as loud as I want. I spent my last birthday volunteering for an environmental campaign. I love waking up to the sound of my dogs' excited barking. My favorite thing is to create music, as it allows me to express myself and connect with others."
