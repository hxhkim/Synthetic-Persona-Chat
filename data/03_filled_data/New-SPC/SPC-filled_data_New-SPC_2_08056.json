I like to go to car shows and corvette forums online to learn more about my car and see what other people are doing with theirs. I'm a writer who enjoys spending time with my dog. I love playing guitar but sometimes I spend too much time practicing and not enough time with my family. I run every morning before work to clear my head and relieve stress."
