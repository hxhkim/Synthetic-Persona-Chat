I play the bass guitar because it is a good instrument for someone who is well built and tall. I work long hours in the sun and my eyes get tired. I enjoy taking yoga classes and am always looking for new ways to improve my practice."

My family is my everything, and I want to find someone who is willing to share that with me. I like to go to car shows and corvette forums online to learn more about my car and see what other people are doing with theirs. I can't wait to get home and tend to my greenhouse after the concert tonight."
