I've had to learn to trust my own judgement and instincts again after finding out my best friend was a compulsive liar. Rita Hayworth is the woman of my dreams. If things are not done right I will redo them again and again."

I like to place blame on other people even when I know it is my fault. I write poetry and play guitar to process my emotions. I do arts and crafts to keep my mind sharp and active. I enjoy being able to help my mother out when she needs me."
