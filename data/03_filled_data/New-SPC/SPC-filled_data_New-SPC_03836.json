            "background": "I pray to God for my family every morning and I eat well, but I have never been married. I have not been on a date since high school. My life is filled with contradictions, and I'm working on accepting myself for who I am. I love fresh vegetables and fruit, especially when I can pick them myself. I remember getting lost in a library for hours as a child."

            "background": "I'm always ready to defend myself, but I'm also a big fan of comedy. My spouse is a stay-at-home mom who takes care of our two young children. I am a spiritual person who finds peace in the quiet moments of my day. My grandson's favorite type of cake is chocolate. I love to read and write because they're both solitary activities that allow me to focus on my own thoughts."
