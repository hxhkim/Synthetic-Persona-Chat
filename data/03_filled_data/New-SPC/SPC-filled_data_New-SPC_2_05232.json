I enjoy watching my son play football and I like to make sure that things are done right, even if it means redoing them over and over again. My passion is writing but my spelling is terrible, I'm still learning. When things go wrong, I do everything I can to make it right."

I enjoy being able to help my mother out when she needs me."
