I grill salmon and vegetables on my George Foreman grill at home for a quick and healthy meal. I found a hidden cave in the mountains while hiking with my dogs. I eat my feelings. I want to be a good role model for my daughters."

            "background": "I used to play with animals, but now I'm too busy with my work. I would brag about being a good father and making my family happy. My video game collection is my most valued material possession because it reminds me of the good times I had playing games with my family and friends. I'm happy to have a close family and met Jimmy Fallon the other day. Last year, I found inspiration in the world and used it to help my clients with their taxes."
