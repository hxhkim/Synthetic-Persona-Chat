I have a pet dog named Sunshine who loves to play in my sunflower field. I like to go to car shows and corvette forums online to learn more about my car and see what other people are doing with theirs. I like to keep my personal life private.

I live in a small apartment with my cat Charlie, but I dream of having a house with a big yard so they can run around. I'm a bit nervous about going to the baby shower because I'm worried about being stared at. I have no use for a crib, but I would love to have a music studio in my dorm room. I've been with my current partner for three years, and we're going strong."
