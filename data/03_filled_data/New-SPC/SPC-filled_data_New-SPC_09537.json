I was a hockey player in my youth, but now I enjoy spending my time fishing and relaxing. It's a bit chilly, but I'm looking forward to taking my dog hiking later. I'd be scared to tell my family, but I think they'd be accepting."

My most interesting experience was meeting one of my favorite celebrities and getting his autograph when I was growing up in New Hampshire. I'm looking forward to starting my career and making a difference in the world."
