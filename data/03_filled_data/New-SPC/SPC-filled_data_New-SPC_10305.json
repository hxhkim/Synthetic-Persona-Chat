I live in my parent's basement and work a lot, so I usually don't have time for a healthy diet or exercise. My daily routine is pretty relaxed as I'm taking a year off before college, but I like to make sure I keep busy and get some reading in on the weekends."

I celebrated my birthday with a small party and a trip to the dog park with my French bulldog. My mom is my favorite person of all people. Black coffee is my addiction. I don't know if I enjoy programming, or if it's my only choice."
