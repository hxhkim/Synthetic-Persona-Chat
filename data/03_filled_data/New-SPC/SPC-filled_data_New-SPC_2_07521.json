I'm a bit of a klutz but I'm comfortable with who I am and I'll do everything I can to give my child a good future. I want to learn how to play the guitar so I can perform my favorite pop songs in front of my friends. I'm going to see my brother this weekend to take my mind off my wife."

I can't get enough gummy worms to satisfy my sweet tooth. I wake up early to practice my music before my sister and niece and nephew wake up. I love watching sitcoms on television."
