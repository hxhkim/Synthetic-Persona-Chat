You'll need lye, water, oils, and fragrance oil. Lye is very caustic, so it's important to be careful when handling it. You'll also need a mold to pour the soap into. Once you have your supplies, you can begin making the soap. The first step is to dissolve the lye in water. This will create a chemical reaction that produces heat. Once the lye is dissolved, you can add the oils and fragrance oil. You'll need to stir the mixture until it's completely emulsified. Then, you can pour the soap into the mold. The soap will need to cure for a few weeks before it's ready to use."
